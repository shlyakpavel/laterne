# Traffic light app for Ivideon

I've done this with nothing good on my mind because I`m a cinnabun. I was not carefull enough so I didn't get an interview there.
The problems they've mentioned:
- Tcp socket can get more than one command, or just a part of it. This is not handled.
- Packet length is not handled properly
- It is pretty hard to extend the network implementation.
- URL is not checked and no errors are shown if the connection is lost ot not possible to establish.

And there are many more they didn't notice, just trust me.
